All images in this repository are public domain/CC0 and can be used without any limitation by anybody.

## Background

The EU just passed article 13/17, which has the potential to ban memes (due to copyright) in the EU. To prevent this, we need to create our own memes and distribute them under a license, which allows the free usage of those images without further consent of the creator or publish them to the public domain (like the ones in this repository).
